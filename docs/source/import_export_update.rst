Import, Export, Update
======================

The Import / Export / Update tool lets you perform some batch actions in Janeway. You can import and export article metadata and files, and you can update some fields of existing articles.

The tool is distributed as a plugin for Janeway, you'll need to ask your site administrator to install it before you can start using. If you are preparing a CSV import, we recommend visiting the tool-specific documentation in order to understand what columns are required, as well as the valid data types/choice values for each column: https://janeway-imports.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
