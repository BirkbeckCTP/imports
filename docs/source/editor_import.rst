Editors Import
==============

The editor import tool allows you to create editor accounts by uploading a CSV (Comma Seperated Value) file.

.. warning:: This importer is site specific. You should be accessing the import tool from the press or journal you want it import the editors into.

To import editor accounts:

1. Download the :download:`editors import template <_static/editor_import_template.csv>`.
2. Enter your editor's details, one per row.
3. On the Imports Plugin main page select **Editors Import** and click **Start Import**.
4. Select your CSV and, if you want you editors to receive a password reset notification check that option.
5. Click **Import** to complete the process.

.. warning:: It is important that you let editors know before you user the password reset function as it can result in editors suspecting the message is spam.

.. tip:: Download the :download:`editors import sample <_static/editor_import_sample.csv>` CSV to see example data.
