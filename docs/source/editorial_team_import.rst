Editorial Team Import
=====================

The Editorial Team Import allows you to create your editorial team by uploading a CSV (Comma Seperated Value) file.

.. note:: If you include a user in your editorial team CSV that does not yet have an account one will be created for them. If an account already exists that account will be added as a group member. Accounts created during this import are not assigned any roles.

To import your editorial team:

1. Download the :download:`editorial team template <_static/editorial_team_template.csv>`.
2. Enter the details of your editorial team members, one per row.
3. The last field "group name" should match for all the members you want to be in the same group eg. "Editor" or "Reviews Editors".
4. On the Imports Plugin main page select **Editorial Team Import** and click **Start Import**.
5. Upload your file.
6. Click **Import** to complete the process.

If you have enabled the Editorial Team page these groups and members will be live. If not you can view them from the Editorial Team page on the Journal Manager.

.. tip:: Download the :download:`editorial team sample <_static/editorial_team_sample.csv>` CSV to see example data.
