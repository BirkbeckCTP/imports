Reviewer Import
===============

The Reviewer import tool allows you to create reviewer accounts by uploading a CSV (Comma Seperated Value) file.

.. warning:: This importer is site specific. You should be accessing the import tool from the press or journal you want it import the reviewers into.

To import reviewer accounts:

1. Download the :download:`reviewer import template <_static/reviewer_import_template.csv>`.
2. Enter your reviewer details, one per row.
3. If you wish to add more than one interest you should separate them with a semi colon eg. interest one; interest two; interest three.
4. On the Imports Plugin main page select **Reviewer Import** and click **Start Import**.
5. Select your CSV and, if you want you reviewers to receive a password reset notification check that option.
6. Click **Import** to complete the process.

.. warning:: It is important that you let reviewers know before you user the password reset function as it can result in reviewers suspecting the message is spam.

.. tip:: Download the :download:`reviewer import sample <_static/reviewer_import_sample.csv>` CSV to see example data.
